# Smart Parking Lot Management (C++)

## ğŸ“Œ Overview

A minimal, command-line Smart Parking Lot Management System written in C++.  
This program allows users to park vehicles, remove vehicles, and display the current status of each slot using basic arrays and struct data structures.

---

## ğŸ›  Features

- Park a vehicle (if slots are available)
- Remove a vehicle (by slot number or registration number)
- Display the current status of all slots
- Simple menu-based user interface
- Uses only standard C++ (`iostream`)â€”no STL or external libraries

---

## ğŸ“‚ Data Structures Used

- **Struct:** To store each vehicle's registration, owner, and occupancy status
- **Static array:** Represents the parking lot slots
- **Simple menu logic** within a single file

## ğŸš— Running Locally

This repository contains the source code for my Data Structures project submission: a minimal Smart Parking Lot Management System in C++.

**To run locally:**

1. **Download or clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-parking-lot.git
    cd smart-parking-lot
    ```

2. **Compile the C++ program:**
    ```
    g++ parking.cpp -o parking
    ```

3. **Run the executable:**
    ```
    ./parking
    ```

> _This project is submitted as part of my Design of Data Structures in C++._
