# DDS-PROJECTS
# Data Structures Mini Projects (C++)

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a collection of minimalist C++ command-line projects developed for Data Structures coursework.  
Each project focuses on a fundamental data structure concept, and is implemented using only standard C++ with `iostream` (and no STL unless explicitly stated).  
Code is intentionally kept as simple and portable as possible for educational clarity and project submission.

## 🗂️ Projects Included

### 1. Tower of Hanoi Visualizer
- Recursively solves the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
- Visualizes rods and disks using ASCII art after every move.
- User selects disk count (up to 20).
- Simple arrays and recursion (no STL containers).

### 2. Smart Parking Lot Management
- Menu-based minimal parking lot manager.
- Park and remove vehicles, display all slot statuses.
- Uses array and struct for managing the parking slots.
- Designed for easy demonstration of simple data structure logic.

### 3. Expression Calculator
- Converts infix mathematical expressions to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) using stack logic.
- Evaluates postfix expressions, handling all operator precedence and parentheses.
- Entirely array-based stack implementation (no STL).
- Supports standard arithmetic operators and parenthetical grouping.

## 🚀 Running a Project Locally

To run any project, use the following general steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ds-mini-projects.git
    cd ds-mini-projects
    ```

2. **Navigate into the desired project folder (if separated), or use the correct `.cpp` file.**

3. **Compile:**
    ```
    g++ project_name.cpp -o project
    ```

4. **Run:**
    ```
    ./project
    ```

> _Each project folder or file contains a more detailed README and instructions inside._
